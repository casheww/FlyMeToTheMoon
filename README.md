# FlyMeToTheMoon
BepInEx plugin for Rain World that gives slugcat the ability to sing




This project is currently a work in progress.
### TODO:
- config machine menu for customisable hotkeys
- actual audio that isn't just a single note in a voice that makes your ears bleed
- related interactions...?
- perhapsibly include harmonising for jolly co-op
